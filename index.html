      <div class="two-col">
       <p>Whatever tree care service you require be reassured to know that all our work is carried out to the highest of standards, in line with NPTC Certification and BS3998 (British Standard for Tree Work) regulations, we are fully insured (Through ArboRisk) and all our documents can be seen on request.</p>
       <p>Being Qualified through the NPTC we are able to fell all manner of tree, from shrub and hedge, through to Forestry and onto Emergency Operations, covering all forms of  catastrophic failure from decay to weather.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="two-col">
       <p>We are also fully able to conduct climbing operations. We understand the importance of trees, their place in our community and often in our customers hearts, we therefor strive to offer every possible solution to all your tree requirements not just to the limit of felling.</p>
       <p>Your tree may just require an health inspection, which being conducted aerially will allow us to be the most thorough, we can spot potential hazards early be that disease and decay, fungal infection or failure.</p>

       <p>We provide all types of pruning, be that re-shaping, lifting of the crowns hight, reduction of the crowns diameter and/or the reduction of the crows density, thrus allowing more light to pass through the canopy, so you can enjoy the sunlight (This can also allow wind through more freely, which in turn reduces stress that can lead to damage and/or failure). We are always happy to perform a cleaning of the crown, this consists of the removal of malformed and rubbing branches along with the removal of dead wood. We are also able to conduct pollarding, this is a technique which nowadays is used primarily to maintain trees at a determined height.
       <p>If your are unsure, maybe on some of the terminology or would like more information before you make a decission, send us a message and we will strive to point you in the right direction and give you all the help we can before hand, if your decission is uninformed, you feel a lack of confidence and we dred that you feel unconfterbale at any stage, HH Treecare has failed in it's ethos. We urge you to get a second opinion and strive to match quotes from any other reputable firm, we cant guarentee we will always be the cheapest but we will always give you the best service we possibly can.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="two-col">
       <p>Through Qualification and Experience we can safely employ a manor of proven techniques, which allow us to dismantle trees in tightest of places with the greatest of care, no matter the complexity, this truly is our passion.</p>
       <p>We happily collaborate with local trade first and foremost, offering our climbing services and our ability to operate specialist machinery, from supply and logistics through to the assisting of our local gardeners. we are also proud to work for or alongside our local landscapers, be that activly involved in the planning phase of the project or just conducting all necessary tree works, clearance, stump/root removal, new planting and aftercare. Client satisfaction is crutial every step of the way.</p>
       <p>Owner Martin, along his journey, has even been called upon to enter a canopy in order to recover a clients remote controlled quadcopter/drone, so if you requier asset recovery (inclusive of pets) please consider calling on us before you attempt to enter the canopy yourself, we climb as a proffesion and take every precaution possible to ensure safety at all times.</p>

      <h2>A little about us</h2>
      <div class="two-col">
       <p>The vision of HH Treecare was first established in July 2017, with the Birth of owner Martin's Son Henry Hawthorn.</p>
       <p>Owner Martin, Having previously served twelve years in Her Majesties Forces, ensures we have the British Army's values and standards firmly ingrained into our ethos. Honesty and Integrity are our primary modus operandi, we strive to be punctual, well equipped and well presented. We are committed to customers and community loyalty, with respect to all other parties involved in our operations. We show equal commitment to our working environment being left in a tidy manor, we always look to check in with our customer before we leave and strive to achieve a hundred percent customer satisfaction.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="two-col">
       <p>HH Treecare started it's journey by establishing a solid foundation of training through Mr Tony Darbyshire of SawPod Ltd. Tony was and still is available to share with us a wealth of experience and knowledge, himself being an instructor in Arboriculture since 1987. His resume alone would require a website of it's own, however his highlights would involve teaching at both Merrist Wood (Surrey) and Sparsholt College (Hampshire) before establishing his own school of training in Andover. His career has taken him all over the world, from Australia and France through too the Indonesian island of Sumatra in the cause of protection of the critically endangered Sumatran orangutan population.</p>

       <p>After initial Training, Martin then found it critical to implement an action plan in the case of emergencies, climbing and saw work is inherently dangerous so we needed to have first aid training and a plan in place, there may also be situations where we are called upon for a rapid response in the case of Emergency Tree Work.</p>
       <p>Already having an background in First Aid through the military and first hand exposure in hostile environments, we understand it's importance, seconds count.</p>
       <p>This skill set needed to be transfer into the civilian sector, having now achieved Industry recognized certification through VTQ we look to further develop by keeping current with legislation and procedures as well as routinely conducting rehearsals in the case of a medical emergency.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="two-col">
       <p>We also look to gain further Certification, which will then allow us to provide our own Training Packages.</p>
       <p>In the aspect of Emergency Tree Works, we then went onto achieve further NPTC qualification and have had the best of opportunities to put this into practice by working along side the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency"style="color:firebrick">Environment Agency</a>. This has given us real time experience in the dismantle of windblown, uprooted and failed trees, of many different species which all require slightly different approaches using all manner of different techniques, including winching, working around and actually in (Both Trees and Operators fully submerged) the River Don.</p>
       <p>We are also grateful to have had the opportunity to train and work with <a href="http://www.powerlinesurveying.co.uk/"style="color:firebrick">PLS Ltd</a>, which has given exposure to the Utility Arboricultural Industry and Highways England, Cutting and Clearing along the roadside both at Day and Night.</p>
